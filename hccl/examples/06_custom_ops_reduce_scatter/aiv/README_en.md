# Custom Communication Operator - ReduceScatter Communication

## Sample Description

This sample demonstrates how to develop an ReduceScatter custom communication operator based on the HCCL AIV communication programming interface. Key features:

1. Implement an ReduceScatter collective communication operator based on the AIV (AI Vector) communication engine.
2. Contains both Host-side operator logic and Device-side Kernel implementation.
3. Provides a complete compilation, build, and test verification process.

## 1. Environment Preparation

### 1.1 Environment Requirements

This sample supports the following products in a single-server N-card configuration (N >= 2):

- Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT

### 1.2 Install the CANN Toolkit Development Kit Package

Refer to the [Ascend Documentation Center - CANN Software Installation Guide](https://www.hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityInstWizard) to install the latest version of the CANN Toolkit development kit package.

### 1.3 Configure Environment Variables

Using the root user default installation path as an example:

```bash
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

Additionally, running test cases requires an MPI environment. Ensure that MPI is installed and configured.

## 2. Compilation and Execution

This sample provides a CMake-based build process.

### 2.1 Compile the Custom Operator Library

Run the following commands in the sample root directory:

```bash
bash build.sh --vendor=cust --ops=reduce_scatter_aiv --custom_ops_path=./examples/06_custom_ops_reduce_scatter/aiv
```

> Where:
> 
> - `--vendor` specifies the custom operator identifier.
> - `--ops` specifies the custom operator name.
> - `--custom_ops_path` specifies the custom operator project path.

### 2.2 Installing the Custom Operator Package

The custom operator installation package is located in the `./build_out` directory. Install it using the `--install` parameter:

```bash
./build_out/cann-hccl_custom_reduce_scatter_aiv_linux-<arch>.run --install --install-path=<ascend_cann_path>
```

> Where:
> 
> - `<arch>` is the system architecture of the current compilation environment.
> - `<ascend_cann_path>` is an optional parameter indicating the CANN software package installation directory. The default value is the CANN software package path where the `ASCEND_CUSTOM_OPP_PATH` or `ASCEND_OPP_PATH` environment variable is located.

The custom operator package installation information is as follows:

- Header file: `${ASCEND_HOME_PATH}/opp/vendors/cust/include/hccl_custom_reduce_scatter.h`
- Dynamic library: `${ASCEND_HOME_PATH}/opp/vendors/cust/lib64/libhccl_custom_reduce_scatter.so`

> `${ASCEND_HOME_PATH}` is the CANN-Toolkit installation path.

### 2.3 Run Test Cases

Test Sample has generated at `2.1 Compile the Custom Operator Library`, the binary file path is:
`./build/examples/06_custom_ops_reduce_scatter/testcase/custom_reduce_scatter_test`

```bash
# run the sample binary directly
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ASCEND_HOME_PATH}/opp/vendors/cust/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
cd build/examples/06_custom_ops_reduce_scatter/testcase/
mpirun -n rank_size ./custom_reduce_scatter_test data_len
Parameter Description:
rank_size: used rank number
data_len: date length
```

### 2.4 Expected Results

After successful execution, the terminal displays log output similar to the following (using 2 cards as an example):
