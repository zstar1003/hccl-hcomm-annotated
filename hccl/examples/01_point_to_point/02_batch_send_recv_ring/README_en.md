# Point-to-Point Communication - HcclBatchSendRecv (Ring)

## Sample Description

This sample demonstrates how to use the `HcclBatchSendRecv()` API to implement point-to-point communication in a ring topology. It covers the following functions:

- Call `aclrtGetDeviceCount()` to detect devices and query the number of available devices.
- Call `HcclGetRootInfo()` and use `rank 0` as the root rank to generate the rootinfo identifier.

  > The rootinfo identifier contains the device IP address and device ID. This information must be broadcast to all ranks in the cluster to initialize the communicator.

- In each thread, call `HcclCommInitRootInfo()` to initialize the communicator based on the rootinfo identifier.
- Call the `HcclBatchSendRecv()` API to send data to the next node while receiving data from the previous node, and display the result.

## Environment Preparation

### Environment Requirements

This sample supports the following products in a single-server N-card configuration (N >= 2):

- Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT
- Atlas A3 training products/Atlas A3 inference products
- Atlas A2 training products
- Atlas training products

### Setting Environment Variables

```bash
# Set CANN environment variables. The following uses the root user default installation path as an example.
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

## Compiling and Running the Sample

Run the following commands in the sample code directory:

```bash
make
make test
```

> Note: You can set the `HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE` environment variable to configure the task orchestration expansion location of communication algorithms. For the supported ranges for different product models, see the usage instructions for this environment variable in the [Environment Variable List](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityEnvRef).
>
> ```bash
> # Set the orchestration expansion location of communication algorithms to the AI CPU on the Device side. The Device side automatically selects the corresponding scheduler based on the hardware model.
> export HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE=AI_CPU
> ```

## Sample Output

The `sendBuf` content on each node is initialized to the Device ID. Data is sent to the next node and received from the previous node. Therefore, each node receives the Device ID of the previous node.
