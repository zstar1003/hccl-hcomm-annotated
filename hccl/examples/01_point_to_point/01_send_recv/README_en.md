# Point-to-Point Communication - HcclSend and HcclRecv (Basic Send and Receive)

## Sample Description

This sample demonstrates how to use the `HcclSend()` and `HcclRecv()` APIs to implement point-to-point communication. It covers the following functions:

- Call `aclrtGetDeviceCount()` to detect devices and query the number of available devices.
- Call `HcclGetRootInfo()` and use `rank 0` as the root rank to generate the rootinfo identifier.

  > The rootinfo identifier contains the device IP address and device ID. This information must be broadcast to all ranks in the cluster to initialize the communicator.

- In each thread, call `HcclCommInitRootInfo()` to initialize the communicator based on the rootinfo identifier.
- Call `HcclSend()` and `HcclRecv()` to send and receive data and display the result. Even-numbered ranks (0, 2, 4, 6) send data, while odd-numbered ranks (1, 3, 5, 7) receive data.

## Environment Preparation

### Environment Requirements

This sample supports the following products in a single-server N-card configuration (N >= 2, even number):

- Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT
- Atlas A3 training products/Atlas A3 inference products
- Atlas A2 training products
- Atlas training products

### Setting Environment Variables

```bash
# Set CANN environment variables. The following uses the root user default installation path as an example.
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

## Compiling and Running the Sample

Run the following commands in the sample code directory:

```bash
make
make test
```

> Note: You can set the `HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE` environment variable to configure the expansion mode of communication operators. For the supported ranges for different product models, see the usage instructions for this environment variable in the [Environment Variable List](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityEnvRef).
>
> ```bash
> # Set the communication operator expansion mode to the AI CPU communication engine
> export HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE=AI_CPU
> ```

## Sample Output

The `sendBuf` content on even-numbered nodes is initialized to the Device ID. The data is then sent to the next odd-numbered node. Therefore, each odd-numbered node receives the Device ID of the previous node.

```text
Found 8 NPU device(s) available
rankId: 1, output: [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]
rankId: 3, output: [ 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ]
rankId: 5, output: [ 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ]
rankId: 7, output: [ 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ]
```
