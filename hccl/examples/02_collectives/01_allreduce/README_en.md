# Collective Communication - AllReduce

## Sample Description

This sample demonstrates how to call the `HcclAllReduce()` API to perform an `AllReduce` operation. It covers the following functions:

- Call `aclrtGetDeviceCount()` to detect devices and query the number of available devices.
- Call `HcclGetRootInfo()` and use `rank 0` as the root rank to generate the rootinfo identifier.

  > The rootinfo identifier contains the device IP address and device ID. This information must be broadcast to all ranks in the cluster to initialize the communicator.

- In each thread, call `HcclCommInitRootInfo()` to initialize the communicator based on the rootinfo identifier.
- Call `HcclAllReduce()` to sum the input data of all ranks in the communicator, send the result to all ranks, and display the result.

## Environment Preparation

### Environment Requirements

This sample supports the following products in a single-server N-card configuration (N >= 2):

- Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT
- Atlas A3 training products/Atlas A3 inference products
- Atlas A2 training products
- Atlas training products/Atlas inference products

### Setting Environment Variables

```bash
# Set CANN environment variables. The following uses the root user default installation path as an example.
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

## Compiling and Running the Sample

Run the following commands in the sample code directory:

```bash
make
make test
```

> Note: You can set the `HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE` environment variable to configure the expansion mode of communication operators. For the supported ranges for different product models, see the usage instructions for this environment variable in the [Environment Variable List](https://hiascend.com/document/redirect/CannCommunityEnvRef).
>
> ```bash
> # Set the communication operator expansion mode to the AI CPU communication engine
> export HCCL_OP_EXPANSION_MODE=AI_CPU
> ```

## Sample Output

The data of each rank is initialized to 0 through 7. After the AllReduce operation, the result on each rank is the sum of the data at the corresponding positions of all ranks (the data of 8 ranks is added).

```text
Found 8 NPU device(s) available
rankId: 0, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 1, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 2, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 3, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 4, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 5, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 6, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
rankId: 7, output: [ 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 ]
```
