This directory contains the HCCL test code, which is divided into system tests (ST) and unit tests (UT).

## Test Types

### System Test (ST)

System tests mainly verify the correctness of HCCL collective communication algorithm logic, including memory operation validation and semantics validation.

#### Algorithm Analyzer

The algorithm analyzer verifies algorithm logic and memory operation functions by simulating the HCCL single-operator execution flow.

**Principle:**

1. The algorithm analyzer stubs the dependencies (hcomm and runtime interfaces) of the HCCL single-operator flow to obtain the Task sequences of all ranks during algorithm execution.
2. The Task information of all ranks is formed into a **directed acyclic graph**.
3. Validation is performed based on **graph algorithms**, including memory read-write conflict checking and semantics checking.

**Core Functions:**

- **Memory conflict checking**: Analyzes whether there are possible read-write conflicts based on the synchronization situation in the Task graph.
- **Semantics checking**: Simulates Task graph execution, records data movement information, and verifies whether the data movement in the output memory meets the operator requirements.

For details, see the [Algorithm Analyzer Guide](./st/algorithm/README_en.md).

### Unit Test (UT)

Run the following commands in the repository root directory:

```bash
# Compile and run all unit test cases
bash build.sh --ut

# Compile and run all system test cases
bash build.sh --st
```
