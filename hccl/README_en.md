## Overview

The Huawei Collective Communication Library (HCCL) is a high-performance collective communication library based on the Ascend AI processor. It provides high-performance and reliable communication solutions for computing clusters with the following core features:

- Provides high-performance collective communication and point-to-point communication in single-node and multi-node environments.
- Supports collective communication primitives such as AllReduce, Broadcast, AllGather, ReduceScatter, and AlltoAll.
- Supports communication algorithms such as Ring, Mesh, and Recursive Halving-Doubling (RHD).
- Supports high-speed communication links such as HCCS, RoCE, and PCIe.
- Supports both single-operator and graph execution modes.

HCCL is a core component of CANN. It supports multiple AI frameworks upward and enables communication capabilities among multiple Ascend AI processors downward. The following figure shows the software architecture:

HCCL consists of the HCCL collective communication library and the HCOMM (Huawei Communication) basic communication library:

- HCCL: includes built-in and extended communication operators, and provides external communication operator APIs.
- [HCOMM](https://gitcode.com/cann/hcomm): adopts a layered and decoupled design, dividing communication capabilities into a control plane and a data plane.
